# InterSploit
I am not responsible for any illegal act and I did not create this tool for hacking but only for detection of vulnerabilities.
I do not assume any kind of responsibilities and you are the only one responsible for what you do with this tool.
That is why do not use this tool in any illegal act. Thanks
This tool contains several features and is used to discover router and communication vulnerabilities, as well as sites that detect the admin page and also search for open ports in the router and I will add many tools to it to include everything related to networks.
The tool is used in Kali Linux & termux
